# The Terminal Angel Disease


The "Terminal Angel Disease" is a classic top-down role 
playing game which could have been published in the early 90s. 
It was developed by one-man-hobby-indie company Captainsoft over the 
course of twenty years.  
You can play the game via Itch.io: https://captainsoft.itch.io/the-terminal-angel-disease

Here you can stalk and enjoy the source code. 400+ classes of the finest object-oriented code
and some elegant use of a variety of design patterns. 
**No library** was used in the making of this game. This version was written 
from 2010-2015 in Java 1.6. It is a great source for java, object-orientend-programming
and 2D tile based game programing. Note that the originial version of the
game was written in Visual Basic in 1998, and some of the data files are 
converted at runtime.

You can get the game running via the source code if you combine the 
game files (including the assets) and get the directory structure right. 
Should be fairly easy.

The project is structured into several top level packages. "TADr" is the game 
logic, whereas "spark" is Captainsoft's own game framework respectively. In the 
future, I plan to extract the framework as a project of its own.
