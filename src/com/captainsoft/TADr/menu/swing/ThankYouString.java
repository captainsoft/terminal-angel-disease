 * Yeahhhh here you go... I did this game completely on my own (...) But I'd like to thank all the people and
 * stuff and things that made my life in the last five years (a bit) easier. And if a junior game developer reads
 * this: I have one advice for you: "DON'T DO IT!" This one is one of the last classes I've written in this project.
 * Thank you, I'm out.
